# MovieLens Dashboard (Week 3)

This is a lightweight Streamlit scaffold for the Week 3 dashboard exercise. It provides an outline with tabs for Questions 1â€“4 and a cached data loader.

## Project layout
Everything lives and runs inside this directory to avoid merge conflicts in PRs.
- App: `app.py`
- Data (relative path expected by the app): `../../data/movie_ratings.csv`
- Local deps: `requirements.txt`


## Setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run locally
From this directory:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
